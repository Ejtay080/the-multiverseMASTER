This is the game me and Evan are making.





DISCLAIMER

A majority of the things featured in this game are not by the developer. The only reasons various music tracks, sprites, head-canon stories or AU's are actually featured in this game are either because they are copyrighted and their owners do not have a problem if their content is used as long as they are credited, or certain pieces of work are either forgotten and/or considered dead by the community. While scenes and events in this game follow the canonical storylines given to those certain AU's, some events are merely headcanons from fans of certain alternate universes--whether approved by the AU's creator or not--to improve and modify the performance or execution of that universe altogether.

No matter how complete and official this fan-game may seem, some events may still be considered nonsensical, confusing, illogical or simply incorrect by players of the original Undertale game or members of the AU community in the mere future. As well as the fact that this game includes 'Public AUs' where absolutely anyone can share their own stories that take place in those certain alternate universes.

Finally, this project is not affiliated with Toby Fox in any way. The only things Toby Fox has helped with on this project--at the moment--is creating the original Undertale game itself.

Thank you.
